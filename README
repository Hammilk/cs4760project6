PROJECT: PROJECT 5

The purpose of this project is to simulate memory calls with the implementation of paging.

I set the program to end after 5 real life seconds but tbh it's more interesting if you let it run.


The following are the user input parameters for this project:
-h "Help" Brings up user parameters for project
-n "proc" Total amount of children to be launched
-s "simul" Simultaneous amount of children that can be launched
-t "timeLimitforChildren" The period of time the children will exist for
-i "intervalInMsToLaunchChildren" The upper bound of a tie interval of which the parent will launch the children
-f "logfile" This input is the name of the logfile that you would like to write to. Add suffix ".txt" if you want file to be .txt file.

To compile the project. Enter "make" into the command line and run "./oss".

Outstanding Issues:
None known

To clean files, enter "make clean" into the command line.
